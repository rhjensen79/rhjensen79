# About

I am an independant contractor, at my company 12F (Reference to the [12 factor app](https://12factor.net)), helping customers move into the wonderfull world of cloud Native.
I do that, with a combined knowledge of the Cloud Native ecosystem, and values, and my background in Virtualization, working for VMware.

Most code you find here, is created for demos, so use accordingly.
