# About
I am a Lead Systems Engineer, in the modern applications business unit @[VMware](https://www.vmware.com), working on the [Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com) portfolio of products.
I have an infrastructure background, but i'm trying to learn more dev and less ops, and if i'm lucky, mayby how to put them together :-)

Most code you find here, is created for demos, so use accordingly.
